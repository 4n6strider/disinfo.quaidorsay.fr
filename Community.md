### 1. **The Rapid Alert System (RAS)**

The EEAS has set up a Rapid Alert System enabling all Member States to share information and notify one another of disinformation campaigns.

#### By whom ?

The Rapid Alert System was officially created in December 2018 as part of the European External Action Service's (EEAS) Action Plan against Disinformation, and was launched in March 2019. Commission services such as DG DIGIT, DG COMM, DG CNECT are active contributors to its building.

#### What ?

The RAS mechanism is based on collaboration.
Through a secure digital platform, EU Member States (as each Member State has an official national contact point) and relevant national representatives or experts can discuss, share information on past and ongoing foreign disinformation campaigns with one another, share useful tools and efficient pratices and ultimately coordinate responses.

Moreover, the RAS allows its members to warn other members of ongoing information manipulation. Today, the main topic at hand are the upcoming European elections, national elections withtin the EU, disinformation campaigns and solutions to be implemented.

The RAS is no security hazard since what is shared through it is crucial yet not sensitive intelligence. European and national security is thus not only preserved, but increased, thanks to the improvement and gain in the level of information and expertise, constituting a solid, lasting basis to better fight disinformation and its consequences.

It is providing immediate and centralized access to various information from reliable, heterogeneous agents, information that would have been rather complex to obtain and classify at a merely national level.

#### What for ?

The main goal of the RAS is to ease and increase the speed of information (trends, reports, analyses, etc.) sharing among relevant actors, thus allowing more efficient and direct communication around common stakes. Ultimately, quicker, more efficient and possibly synchronized responses should emerge.

This tool has many other advantages. For instance, knowledge mutualization is essential to better define and understand disinformation and its outcomes. A better circulation of information flows, combined to a sharing principle, allows for mutual and active learning.

This not only improves the quality of the shared information, it also improves the reaction to this information while decreasing its delay of implementation.

Step by step, the mechanism aims at creating resilience within governments as well as within civil society.

#### For whom ?

The RAS is open to EU Member States as well as relevant european and national representatives or experts. It is destined to help all actors (state or non-state) who actively fight disinformation.

#### Additional information

No classified information is shared on the RAS, which works on the basis of  open source intelligence (OSINT), an information collection and analysis method based on data coming from public, open sources.

Data is stored on a secure, encrypted server and access to RAS domains is limited to its members and requires two-factor authentication.

### 2. [**EUvsDisinfo**](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/)

#### By whom ?

_EU versus Disinformation_ is a campaign of the European External Action Service (EEAS) East Stratcom Task Force launched in March 2015.

#### What ?

The campaign is supported by a [website](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/news/) as well as several social media accounts ( [Twitter](https://twitter.com/euvsdisinfo) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/EUvsDisinfo/) ).
EUvsDisinfo focuses on "pro-Kremlin" disinformation campaigns, more precisely "_on key messages carried in the media, which have been identified as providing a partial, distorted or false view or interpretation and spreading key pro-Kremlin messaging_". News are selected based on two criteria: 1) factual falsehood 2) origin and alinement with "_identified pro-Kremlin disinformation messaging_".

Their fact-checking articles are produced, published and shared almost daily and are accessible to all. On the website can be found fact-check and debunk articles, then compiled on a large database of over 5 000 disinformation cases in 18 different languages. Every week since November 2015 is published a [Disinformation Review](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/disinfo-review/) which comprehends said articles as well as news, analyses, studies and reports.

#### What for ?

The aim of the campaign is to "_better forecast, address and respond to pro-Kremlin disinformation_".

#### For whom ?

The weekly Disinformation Review and fact-check articles are public and available to all. Moreover, the campaign team "_[briefs] and [trains] EU institutions, Member State governments, journalists and researchers_". Their articles and analyses are "_regularly quoted and used by politicians, governments, state agencies, researchers, think tanks and journalists across Europe and beyond_".

### 3. [**FactCheck EU**](https://factcheckeu.info/fr/)

#### By whom ?

FactCheck EU was built on an initiative of International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) members by the French newspaper Lib√©ration and the digital design company Datagif.

On the basis of cooperation, it gathers contributions from nineteen European media outlets (such as Le Monde, Newtral, Pagella Politica, Lead Stories and Faktograf) from thirteen countries in the European Union (including France, Germany, Greece, Northern Ireland - and Ireland - Croatia, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Denmark and Sweden).

#### What ?

FactCheck EU offers a [website](https://t.co/Den4RgBOus) with **fact-check articles**, investigation pieces, and a **Q&A**.

It has a direct **public interface for questions**, to better grasp the needs of the public. Questions answered include topics such as the funding for FactCheck EU, the creation of the website, etc. Indeed, founders explicitely seek to build trust and credibility on the basis of transparency.

The articles are published in theme-oriented **categories** (European elections, refugee "crisis"...) and are all **translated at least in English**. They are translated in other languages when deemed relevant; usually the most relevant languages other than English are Spanish and German.

This choice of translation is made based on criteria such as the level of interest of the partners, the degree of literacy in English in the country of publication and the relevance at the EU level. Also, incendiary  or hate-speech related questions and articles are judged less relevant for translation by the creators of FactCheck EU.

#### What for ?

Publishing fact-checks and offering direct answers to the questions of its audience helps FactCheck EU to raise awareness within the civil society (media literacy) as well as providing a reliable, open platform for fact-checkers and media outlets on which to share their information, thereby reaching people throughout the EU and not merely nationally.

#### For whom ?

FactCheck EU's website is open to all. Partnerships are conducted with European-based fact-checking media outlets.

#### Additional information

FactCheck EU is partially financed by the Google News Initiative, the Open Society Initiative for Europe (OSIE) and the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN). The platform was built thanks to a fact-checking innovation grant of the Poynter Institute.

### 5. [**Europe Media Monitor**](http://emm.newsbrief.eu/)

#### By whom ?

EMM is an initiative of the Research and development team in the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission. The JRC is no policy-defining Directorate-General but merely suggests tools.

#### What ?

Europe Media Monitor (EMM) is an analysis system, which gathers _"about 300,000 news articles_" per day in both traditional and social media online worldwide (70 languages). It "_uses advanced information extraction techniques to automatically determine what is being reported in the news, where things are happening, who is involved and what they said_".

EMM has 3 000 categories or topics based on more than 60 000 keywords. After collection, information goes through a pipeline architecture involving a language detector, a geographical matcher, an entity guesser, the extraction of quotes and the determination of the tonality of the article, among other criteria.

News are accessible on the [EMM-NewsBrief](http://emm.newsbrief.eu/NewsBrief/clusteredition/fr/latest.html) website and classified by theme, topic or geographical area. EMM-NewsBrief is updated every ten minutes, 24/7. It can analyze the information collected, produce visual presentations and statistics "_[detect] breaking news and [send] out alerts_".

News are also customizable, which means that users can select specific categories or countries to be shown. Moreover, the Rapid News Service (RNS) can be used by registered organizations "_to further filter the news and to produce their own newsletters [...] in an easy-to-use interface_".

These functions are partially accessible on the free EMM app, which allows its users to "_track [...] and follow news on a given topic [...] and see [...] the biggest stories [...] in the world"_.

#### What for ?

EMM can be used as a monitoring system, which increases the scope of research for journalists. The main idea driving the concept is information reduction. Its synthetizing functionalities help users save time while broadening their scope of analysis.

#### For whom ?

As explained on its website, EMM "_was developed for media analysts, epidemiologists, decision makers and politicians. It is also used by journalists, financial analysts, health experts_" and ordinary citizens.

### 6. [**RevealEU**](https://revealproject.eu/)

#### By whom ?

[REVEAL](https://revealproject.eu/) was one of the first projects of the European Commission dealing with verification of digital content. It started in 2013 and formally ended on 31 December 2016.

#### What ?

The REVEAL project aimed at developing tools (technologies) and services (methodologies) helpful for social media analysis, especially content verification. Its missions were to help analyze and organize information, protray it intuitively and provide context all the while protecting personal data. Its consortium produced open publications available on the REVEAL website.

#### What for ?

Through REVEAL, EU actors seeked to determine the level of trustworthiness of an information, "_predict contributor impact and how much or to what extent all this affects [hidden modalities such as] reputation or influence_", with the overall goal of a "_better understanding and utilization of the social media world_".

#### For whom ?

This project could provide journalists with content, content analysis, tools and services described above. But it also could help companies improving their processes and products through the providing of "_organised, summarised and evaluated_" data.

#### Additional information

REVEAL was funded by the European Union‚Äôs Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration.

### 7. [**InVID**](https://www.invid-project.eu/)

#### By whom ?

InVID is a project co-funded by the European Commission started in January 2016 and achieved in December 2018.

#### What ?

It focused on video verification of "eyewitness media", with the goal to develop an innovative verification platform "_to detect emerging stories and assess the reliability of newsworthy video files and content spread via social media_". Indeed, editing softwares and content management tools increasingly allow for the spread of fabricated, manipulated, deceiving videos. Content verification is costly and time-consuming for news outlets.

The InVID platform was built to help "_detect, authenticate and check the reliability and accuracy of newsworthy video files and video content spread via social media_".

It works through a verification application, a mobile application, a visual analytics dashboard as well as a verification plug-in (among others) which offer online services for video fragmentation, reverse image search and annotation, a logo detection tool, a context aggregation and analysis tool as well as a rights management service.

#### What for ?

InVID allows its users to quickly verify video content and make sure that it is rights-cleared and readily available. It helps avoiding the spread (by mistake) of false information or fakes by media outlets.

#### For whom ?

Mainly, InVID is useful for "_broadcasters, news agencies, web pure-players, newspapers and publishers_" because it allows them "_to integrate social media content into their news output without struggling to know if they can trust the material or how they can reach the user to ask permission for re-use_".

#### Additional information

InVID is a follow-up project of [RevealEU](https://github.com/Ndpnt/desinfo.quaidorsay.fr-wiki/wiki/Community#6-revealeu). [WeVerify](https://weverify.eu/eu-disinfolab/) is a follow-up project of both InVID and [RevealEU](https://github.com/Ndpnt/desinfo.quaidorsay.fr-wiki/wiki/Community#6-revealeu).
