# France's approach

The French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs uses the term "information manipulation".
This term is more inclusive because it allows us to take the coordinated (and often massive and artificial) nature of the dissemination into account.
The notion of a “coordinated campaign” refers to a range of indicators pointing to the diffusion, through various media, of problematic content, by both human and non-human sources.
It illustrates also that information manipulation does not always imply a dichotomy between truth and falsehood. Most of the time, the manipulator does not position himself relative to the truth; he or she is simply trying to produce an effect (e.g. exacerbate existing tensions).

The [2018 French law against information manipulation](https://disinfo.quaidorsay.fr/encyclopedia/reaction/case-studies#legislation) enshrined the use of the term in law.

The French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs’s relies on five [criteria](/encyclopedia):

- an intentional, 
- massive and artificial dissemination;
- of false or biased information;
- for hostile political purposes, including the weakening or destabilization of democratic debate;
- by a foreign actor.


There is no unique definition ! Each organization has its own mandate and along with it, specific criteria.
For example, the European Commission uses the term "disinformation" with the following definition: 
"verifiably false or misleading information that is created,presented and disseminated for economic gain or to intentionally deceive the public,and may cause public harm"
