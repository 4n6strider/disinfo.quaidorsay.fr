# France's approach

## Vocabulary

France prefers the generic term [information manipulation](/encyclopedie/definitions) which allows both to take into account the hostile purpose and the massive and artificial nature of the dissemination, and also to illustrate the fact that the process is not necessarily positioned vis-à-vis the veracity of the information.

France considers, for example, that the term _disinformation_ is both too broad, in the sense that it also includes benign disinformation that lacks a hostile intention, and too narrow because not all processes are, strictly speaking, forms of _disinformation_ (intentional dissemination of information that is wholly or partly false or misleading). Indeed, the information can be false, but it can also be exaggerated, biased, or presented in a very emotional way. 

The [2018 French law against information manipulation](https://disinfo.quaidorsay.fr/encyclopedia/reaction/case-studies#legislation) enshrined the use of the term in law.

## Criterias 

The French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs’s relies on six cumulative [criteria](/encyclopedia):

1. an intentional, 
2. massive,
3. and artificial dissemination,
4. of false or biased information,
5. for hostile political purposes, including the weakening or destabilization of democratic debate,
6. by a foreign actor (state or non-state).
