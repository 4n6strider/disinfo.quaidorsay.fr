## Illegal Ads

#### Assess the legality of political ads

A crowdsourcing interface that allows citizens to view paid issue-based ads on Facebook and surface actors that do not respect the law. Currently only available for France, our code is open-source and we would be happy to collaborate with you to expand to other countries.

## Bot Detection

#### Identify clusters of bots on Twitter

A crawler that navigates Twitter follower relationships to identify clusters of suspicious accounts from a given seed account. It uses the free Twitter API and can thus be easily deployed. 

Based on a manual annotation of over 400&nbsp;accounts, we have also used that dataset to <a href="/encyclopedia/qualification/tools#reliability-assessment">assess the reliability</a> of usual bot detection tools such as Botometer.

## CCollaborationhat chat

A real-time chat that gathers actors, supports all the best practices identified in our encyclopedia, and offers the best tools as chatbots. If you are reading this, then we would probably like to have you on board.
