        <p><i>Fake news, misinformation, disinformationâ€¦</i> The subject is riddled with an abundance of terms mixing different realities. To us, it seems preferable to use the term of information manipulation.</p>
        <p>Information manipulation aims to <strong>disrupt the social cohesion and electoral processes</strong> that keep democratic societies together. It was the documented foreign interference during the 2016 US presidential elections that highlighted large-scale information manipulation primarily aimed at citizens, particularly through social media.</p>
        <p>We believe that neutral online spaces that promote the production and sharing of <strong>quality information</strong>, <strong>plurality of views</strong> and <strong>mutual respect</strong> strengthen our social cohesion and reduce vulnerabilities to information manipulation.</p>
        <p>Within the Office of the French Ambassador for Digital Affairs, our team uses the capabilities of digital diplomacy to build such an environment, by building open tools and by exerting influence to prefigure effective and proportionate regulation.</p>

              Based on a manual annotation of over 400&nbsp;accounts, we have also used that dataset to <a href="/encyclopedia/qualification/tools#reliability-assessment">assess the reliability</a> of usual bot detection tools such as Botometer.
