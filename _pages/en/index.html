        <p><i>Fake news, misinformation, disinformation…</i> The topic is riddled with words covering different realities. We prefer the more generic term <strong>information manipulation</strong>.</p>
        <p>Information manipulation aims at <strong>disrupting the social cohesion and electoral processes</strong> that keep democratic societies together. Foreign interference during the 2016 US presidential elections highlighted new forms of large-scale information manipulation campaigns targeting citizens, mainly through social media. We believe that such campaigns are made possible by the exploitation of <strong>vulnerabilities</strong> in the way information is presented.</p>
        <p>The <strong>attention economy</strong> allows bad actors to gain money and views by publishing content that exploits our biases and tendencies. Techniques such as <i>algorithmic gaming</i>, <i>troll farms</i> or <i>data voids prefilling</i> make it possible to artificially create “engagement”, a metric for visibility that is too often misrepresented as measuring credibility or importance. We work towards online spaces that allow <strong>freedom of expression</strong> and support publishing and sharing <strong>quality information</strong> with a <strong>diversity of views</strong> and <strong>mutual respect</strong>, by reducing such vulnerabilities to information manipulation.</p>
        <p>Within the Office of the French Ambassador for Digital Affairs, our team leverages digital diplomacy to make this environment a reality. We build open tools, connect and promote relevant actors, and steer international governance towards proportionate and effective regulation.</p>

              Based on a manual annotation of over 400&nbsp;accounts, we have also used that dataset to <a href="/encyclopedia/qualification/tools#reliability-assessment">assess the reliability</a> of usual bot detection tools such as Botometer.
