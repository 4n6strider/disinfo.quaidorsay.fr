## It is the right time to share, learn, improve and build

- After EU parliamentary elections that did not show major signs of disinformation campaigns, but before many other major elections in EU countries…
- After new platform rules for political ads transparency, but before any fine-grained data is shared with researchers…
- After dozens of awareness raising articles and political discourse, but before any large-scale education campaign has reached the public…
- After initial laws in some member states, but before the first impact assessment of the European Code of practice…

There have been many great transatlantic conferences for showcasing studies, trying to quantify the impact of disinformation, and discussing whether “fake news” were dealt with and what the next stages of manipulation were.

We want to create a specific space for practitioners to share their practices, tools and experiences in _reacting to_ disinformation campaigns, _attributing_ their source, and _preventing_ their impact on the public. We will also host an open hackathon, during which Facebook will offer a training workshop on the use of the data prepared for its collaboration with [Social Science One](https://socialscience.one).

**The Office of the French Ambassador for Digital Affairs, building [open tools against information manipulation](https://disinfo.quaidorsay.fr), invites you for two days focused on the ways in which we can _actually_ decrease the amount of disinformation citizens are confronted to on a daily basis, today and the day after.**

## Schedule

### June 27<sup>th</sup>: Reaction, Attribution & Prevention Open Space Forum

On this first day, we want participants to share their experience and best practices starting from that moment where they have spotted nasty behaviour. We expect the following topics to be covered:

- **Digital and physical war rooms**: are they sustainable? Can we collaborate across organisational silos?
- **Elves**: are they efficient when grassroots? Are they ethical when coordinated?
- **Rebuttals & denials**: when are they useful? When do they backfire?
- **Facebook’s Third-Party Fact-checking tool**: how does it look like from the inside? What are the most accurate measures of views impact after journalists have flagged content?
- **Data voids preemption**: is it possible to pre-position alternative narratives? When is it questionable?
- **Forensics**: how far should attribution and reaction be decorrelated? Does attributing help in countering a campaign?
- **Educational tools**: have serious games and MOOCs proven effective? Are “nutritional labels” of journalistic practices the way forward?
- **OSINT researchers**: what are the risks taken by individuals who uncover networks? How can they be supported?
- **Social network operators flagging**: how effective are standard channels? Privileged escalation channels?

The format for this first day will be [Open Space Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology): there will be no presenters and attendees, only participants. This format supports much deeper interactions, shaping the conversations around sharing knowledge rather than making assumptions on the audience. You do not need any prior experience with “unconferences” to participate.

### June 28<sup>th</sup>: Research Hackathon

On the second day, we will host a 'research hackathon.' On this occasion, you will be part of teams of social science researchers, developers, data scientists, and other skilled individuals interested in studying and countering disinformation.

You should come if you are interested in exploring ways to make sense of information manipulation, helping make such manipulation more understandable to the public, or building tools to counter it. In particular, you should come if you know how to:

-   Conduct social science research on information diffusion on digital social networks
-   Do data science or datafiddling
-   Create dataviz or drawings
-   Use API plumbing
-   Build chatbots
-   Make half-baked public-facing websites in half a day
-   Write about fact checking and debunking misinformation
-   Ask good, hard questions

As a single day is unfortunately too short to publish credible, peer-reviewed research on the impact of social media on elections, the main goal for studying will be to identify practical hypotheses that can be investigated using available data and tools, and prototype ways to test them.

Members of Facebook's [Election Research Commission](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/new-elections-initiative/) team will join the hackathon to introduce the most recent data and tooling available from Facebook, via the company's collaboration with [Social Science One](https://socialscience.one/) and the [Social Science Research Council](https://www.ssrc.org/programs/view/social-data-initiative/). This will allow participants to generate more likely to be answerable research hypotheses and includes, by order of availability:

1. The Ads Library, which is available to all _[ID-verified](http://facebook.com/id)_ researchers and developers.
2. The CrowdTangle API, which will be available to all participants during the hackathon and to registered researchers after it.
3. The data in the Research Tool, which will be available to all participants during the event only, is a _**synthesized and sampled**_ version of the Social Science One URL shares data set. This dataset will allow researchers to understand the [shape of the data available](https://socialscience.one/files/partnershipone/files/facebook_urls-light_codebook_v1.0.pdf) and its potentials, as well as understand how to conduct research in a differentially private system. In order to test the hypotheses, the full data will be made available to researchers who are accepted into the Social Science One program through the Social Science Research Council.

You can also use public sources such as:

-   Twitter's [political advertisers](https://ads.twitter.com/transparency/i/political_advertisers).
-   [Several millions](https://disinfo.quaidorsay.fr/encyclopedia/research/tools#disinformation-datasets) of troll tweets and accounts.

#### Agenda
> 0900-0915: welcome, description of specific requirements for datasets
> 
> 0915-1100: Onboarding teams that want to use the URLs dataset on the details of the Research Tool.
> 
> 1100-1130: Hear from Social Science One researchers about their research plans (flash-talk style, dedicated room)
> 
> 1130-1200: Break into groups with similar areas of interest, in order to develop research hypotheses in those areas
> 
> 1200-1400: lunch available
> 
> 1200-1700: Hack!
> 
> 1700-1730: wrap up and prepare demo.
> 
> 1730-1830: presentations of groups and closing remarks.

_**PLEASE NOTE:** For those wishing to access the Ads Library API, you must have your identity verified ahead of this meeting. To do so, please follow the instructions below._

**Step 1: Confirm your identity and location:**

-   Go to [Facebook.com/ID](https://www.facebook.com/ID). This is the same ID confirmation required to become authorized to run ads related to politics or issues of national importance. If you haven't already confirmed your ID, it typically takes 1-2 days to complete this step. Sometimes Facebook needs to send you a postcard to confirm your address during this process. Again this step shouldn't take more than a couple days.

**Step 2: Create a Facebook Developer account**

-   [Visit Facebook for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) and select **Get Started**. As part of account creation, you'll need to agree to our [Platform Policy](https://developers.facebook.com/policy/).

**Step 3: Add a new app**

-   Once you have an account, return to this webpage and select *Access the API* to begin making queries. You can create a new app by selecting **My Apps > Add New App**.

### Access

The hours we chose aim to support participants in using low-carbon transportation means. In order to reach the venue:

- From Brussels, you can take the 7:43 [Thalys](https://www.thalys.com/) train and 19:25 back.
- From Amsterdam, you can take the 6:15 [Thalys](https://www.thalys.com/) train and 19:25 back.

These trains reach Gare du Nord, from which you can reach the Invalides metro station in 20 minutes with RER C and RER B, connecting through Saint-Michel-Notre-Dame.

For those participants who would not be able to reach Paris on the same day without flying, we will offer a pre-event dinner on Wednesday the 26<sup>th</sup>.
