- After EU parliamentary elections that did not show major signs of disinformation campaigns, but before many other major elections in EU countries…
- After new platform rules for political ads transparency, but before any fine-grained data is shared with researchers…
- After dozens of awareness raising articles and political discourse, but before any large-scale education campaign has reached the public…
- After laws in some member states, but before the first impact assessment of the European Code of practice…

There have been many great transatlantic conferences for showcasing studies, trying to quantify the impact of disinformation, and discussing whether “fake news” were dealt with and what the next stages of manipulation were.

We want to create a specific space for practitioners to share their practices, tools and experiences in _reacting to_ disinformation campaigns, _attributing_ their source, and _preventing_ their impact on the public. We will also host an open hackathon, during which the first EU technical training workshop for Facebook’s [Social Science One](https://socialscience.one) will offer privileged data access.

**The Office of the French Ambassador for Digital Affairs, building [open tools against information manipulation](https://disinfo.quaidorsay.fr), invites you for two days focused on the ways in which we can _actually_ decrease the amount of disinformation citizens are confronted to on a daily basis, today and the day after.**

## Schedule

### June 27<sup>th</sup>: Reaction, Attribution & Prevention Open Space Forum

On this first day, we want participants to share their experience and best practices starting from that moment where they have spotted nasty behaviour. We expect the following topics to be covered:

- **Digital and physical war rooms**: are they sustainable? Can we collaborate across organisational silos?
- **Elves**: are they efficient when grassroots? Are they ethical when coordinated?
- **Rebuttals & denials**: when are they useful? When do they backfire?
- **Facebook’s Third-Party Fact-checking tool**: how does it look like from the inside? What are the most accurate measures of views impact after journalists have flagged content?
- **Data voids preemption**: is it possible to pre-position alternative narratives? When is it questionable?
- **Forensics**: how far should attribution and reaction be decorrelated? Does attributing help in countering a campaign?
- **Educational tools**: have serious games and MOOCs proven effective? Are “nutritional labels” of journalistic practices the way forward?
- **OSINT researchers**: what are the risks taken by individuals who uncover networks? How can they be supported?
- **Social network operators flagging**: how effective are standard channels? Privileged escalation channels?

The format for this first day will be [Open Space Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology): there will be no presenters and attendees, only participants. This format supports much deeper interactions, shaping the conversations around sharing knowledge rather than making assumptions on the audience. You do not need any prior experience with “unconferences” to participate.

### June 28<sup>th</sup>: Research Hackathon

On the second day, we will host a hackathon pairing social science researchers with developers and data scientists, as well as all talents interested in exploring ways to make sense of information manipulation, make it more understandable to the public, or build tools to counter it. You should come if you know how to do:

- Social science research on information diffusion on digital social networks.
- Datascience or datafiddling.
- Dataviz or drawings.
- API plumbing.
- Chatbots.
- Half-baked public-facing websites in half a day.
- Articles that scare people or articles that reassure people.
- Good, hard questions.

We will use open data sources such as:

- Facebook’s [Ads Library](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/).
- Twitter’s [political advertisers](https://ads.twitter.com/transparency/i/political_advertisers).
- [Several millions](https://disinfo.quaidorsay.fr/encyclopedia/research/tools#disinformation-datasets) of troll tweets and accounts.

By hosting Facebook Social Science One’s first EU technical training on this occasion, we are able to also provide you with have access to:

- The [CrowdTangle](https://www.crowdtangle.com) API.
- A preview of the [URLs dataset](https://socialscience.one/rfps), fine-grained data on the diffusion of links on Facebook. _You will have access to a live system, but the URLs data will be fake: only accredited researchers will have access to it. However, your usage of the tool will enable to improve its API and help researchers define the boundaries of what they could do with it._
