# Political Advertisement in the 2019 EU Parliamentary Elections
{: .no-toc}

As part of our mandate to detect and analyse foreign interference attempts through information manipulation, our team in the Office of the French Ambassador for Digital Affairs studied the availability of data on political ads on major social networks used by Europeans and analysed it to detect potential campaigns targeting French citizens.

We found that the data provided by Facebook, Twitter and Google was systematically inconsistent over time, and that these platforms removed ads from their databases without explanation. Some of the removed ads were illegal in some jurisdictions. We also demonstrated through crowdsourcing that a large proportion of ads classified as “political or issue-based” by Facebook were instead for commercial products, bringing a lot of noise to the dataset.

These findings were shared with the team responsible for the data at Facebook, as well as with Mozilla, which is another signatory of the EU so-called “Code of Practice” on Disinformation, and the cabinets of two European Union commissioners.

## Introduction

All signatories of the EU so-called “Code of Practice” on Disinformation, which in 2019 were Google, Facebook, Twitter and Mozilla, committed to “enable public disclosure of political advertising” and to “use reasonable efforts towards devising approaches to publicly disclose ‘issue-based advertising’” (commitments 3 and 4, respectively).

When deployed on social networks, political and issue-based ads enable micro-targeted political content that can be inconsistent and that caters to existing beliefs. As such, they have been identified as a major vulnerability for information manipulation in electoral contexts. They have for example been considered as a tool for interference in the context of the US 2016 election, or during the Brexit referendum.

### Definitions

“Political advertising” in the context of a digital campaign consists in paying a platform to artificially increase the reach of a piece of content or of an account “advocating for or against the election of a candidate or passage of referenda in national and European elections”.

“Issue-based advertising” is a related practice, where the content that is promoted is not explicitly mentioning a candidate or a party, but is intended to bring awareness to a debate that is of a major importance in the electoral campaign. The distinction between “political” and “issue-based” is strongly based in the [USA legislative context](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue_advocacy_ads), and it is not clear how it relates to European legislations. There is no common agreed-upon definition, and it is thus up to each publisher to decide which is which.

### Assessments

The assessment of all commitments in the “Code of Practice” by the EU Commission is based on self-reporting and compliance is left to other signatories to assess (section V):

> Each Signatory may at any time inform the other Signatories that it believes a Signatory is not complying with its commitments under the Code, and of the grounds for this belief. The Signatories may decide to consider the matter in a plenary meeting. Having heard the Signatory concerned, and after concluding on objective grounds that this Signatory is not willing to respect its commitments under the Code, after all reasonable avenues have been explored, the Signatories may invite such a Signatory to withdraw from the Code. The Signatories will inform the European Commission of this decision.

### Intention

We believe that an issue as important as information manipulation should not be left to platforms to self-regulate and self-assess. This is the reason why, under our mandate to both innovate and detect and analyse foreign interference attempts through information manipulation, we assessed data on political ads provided by signatories of the Code to detect potential campaigns targeting French citizens and prefigure a data-based regulatory and assessment capability.
