							Our main focus at the moment is a chat on steroids: a real-time communication channel where all detection, analysis and reaction can happen in a shared fashion with mutualized tools.<br />
							We have built chatbots that implement the best practices we identified in the encyclopedia.<br />

							We provide opportunities to improve and grow, and identify the most effective ways to decrease the impact of disinformation.
