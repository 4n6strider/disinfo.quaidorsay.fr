# How can I contribute?

All contributions are welcome! We are grateful for all additions to the project. Here, you will find a few easy tips and rules to help you navigate the edition process.

You can edit all pages on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ambanum/disinformation-encyclopedia) hosting the content. You can learn more about this process on the [GitHub help](https://help.github.com/en/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository).

If you are not familiar with the process, feel free to suggest editions [by email](mailto:beryl.bogui@diplomatie.gouv.fr?subject=Contribution).

## Format

For all content to be included in the disencyclopedia, we use the Markdown markup format, with the [Kramdown syntax extensions](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html).

## Hierarchy

When writing content, titles should be organized by importance. To do so, you just need to add a hash (#) in front of the title. The smaller the title, the more hashes you add.

```markdown
# Main title
## Title
### Subtitle
```

To avoid any confusion, we prefer bullet points or #titles to numbered lists (1. ,  2. , 3. etc).
Also, rather than footnotes, we believe direct links included in the text are better for readers.

## Architecture

The content of the encyclopedia is organized along three dimensions: **phase, type and criterion**. When contributing, please add your content in the relevant section. You can learn more about this architecture on our [Concepts](https://disinfo.quaidorsay.fr/encyclopedia/concepts) page.

## Content guidelines

Because we care about fundamental freedoms and security, we **never name non-public personalities** in our content. As this is an encyclopedia, we also **avoid value-based judgement** and favour objective, useful information. Regarding case studies, all **reasoning must be clearly and explicitly justified**: for instance, it is important to know why you believe that an element does or does not fulfill a criteria. It is not sufficient to use “common sense” to explain why some element is false, for example.
