# How can I contribute?

All contributions are welcome ! We are grateful for any valuable addition to the project. Here, you will find a few easy tips and rules to help you navigate the edition process.

You can edit all pages on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ambanum/disinformation-encyclopedia) hosting the content. If you are not familiar with the process, please suggest editions [by email](mailto:beryl.bogui@diplomatie.gouv.fr?subject=Contribution).

## Format

For all content to be included in the disencyclopedia, we use basic [**kramdown** syntax](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html).

## Organization

When writing content, **titles** should be organized by size. To do so, you just need to add a hash (#) in front of the title. The smaller the title, the more hashes you add. 

Ex: # Main title ; ## Title ; ### Subtitle ...

To avoid any confusion, we prefer **bullet points or #titles** to numbered lists (1. ,  2. , 3. etc).
Also, rather than footnotes, we believe **direct links** included in the text are easier for users. 

## Content

The content of the encyclopedia is organized following three main boxes: **phase, type and criterion**. You can find out more about the architecture on our [Concepts](https://disinfo.quaidorsay.fr/encyclopedia/concepts) page.

In the edition process, you will need to use **Github**, an [easy-to-use](https://help.github.com/en/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository) online platform for software development. 

Because we care about fundamental freedoms and security, we **never name non-public personalities** in our content. As this is an encyclopedia, we also **avoid value-based judgement** and favour objective, useful information. Regarding case studies, all **reasoning must be clearly and explicitly justified** : for instance, it is important to know why you believe that an element does or does not fulfill a criteria.
