## [The Pledge for Election Integrity](https://electionpledge.org/)

### Origins

The **Pledge for Election Integrity** was launched by the **Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity** (TCEI), which was created to prevent election interference, alongside activities regarding democratic awareness, media engagement and education. Overall, the TCEI is a “_bi-partisan group of political, tech, business and media leaders that seeks to foster a more collective approach to preventing the next wave of foreign election interference_”.

The Commission is part of the **Campaign for Democracy program**, which “_aims to become the world’s leading eco-system of dissidents and supporters of democracy_” by “_engaging supporters of democracy worldwide and building a powerful intellectual movement_”.

This Campaign was itself launched by the [**Alliance of Democracies Foundation**](http://www.allianceofdemocracies.org/),  a non-profit organization founded by Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the former NATO Secretary General and former Prime Minister of Denmark in 2017. Its core mission is “_the advancement of democracy and free markets across the globe_”.

### What is the Pledge?

The Pledge for Election Integrity is a call from the TCEI to candidates for the upcoming European elections in May 2019. They urge candidates “_to take a stand against election interference by increasing transparency and fight the use of disinformation in campaigns_”.

The Pledge was intentionally launched in a tense, heavy electoral context. Indeed, in the next year or so (2019-2020), major elections will take place in the European Union, the US and Canada. 

### Engagements

Below are the five core engagements of the pledge as listed on the official website. Signatories are:

1. Committing not to fabricate, use or spread **data or materials that were falsified, fabricated**, doxed or stolen for disinformation or propaganda purposes;

2. Avoiding dissemination, doctored audios/videos or images that impersonate other candidates, including **deep fake videos**;

3. Making **transparent the use of bot networks to disseminate messages**; avoid using these networks to attack opponents or using third-parties or proxies to undertake such actions;

4. Taking active steps to maintain **cyber security** and to train campaign staff in **media literacy and risk awareness** to recognise and prevent attacks;

5. Committing to transparency about the sources of campaign **finances**.

### Who signs the Pledge?

Whether they be political parties or candidates seeking office, “_anyone that is or intends to run as a candidate for the European Parliament elections in May 2019, the U.S. elections in November 2020, or the Canadian parliamentary in October 2019 may take the pledge._”

As of May 09th, 2019, 10 candidates have taken the pledge in the European Union, from Germany, the Netherlands, Czech Republic, Belgium, Romania and the U.K. (Scotland).
