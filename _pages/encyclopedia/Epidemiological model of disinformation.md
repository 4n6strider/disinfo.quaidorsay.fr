# Epidemiological model of disinformation

The fight against disinformation is incremental. Each step deals with a specific aspect in the tackling of information, from its creation to its dissemination and spread. An epidemiological view of the issue allows for the drafting of a model which gathers the processes of prevention, research and treatment of disinformation.

## Prevention

Ahead of the propagation of false, misleading and/or harmful information, some actors fighting disinformation dedicate themselves to **sensitization** endeavours, among which can be found **media literacy** initiatives aimed at the civil society, or local **proactive measures** (prevention campaigns, deterrent laws, report mechanisms, etc.), for most of which efficiency remains to be assessed.

## Research

A field of **academic research** regarding disinformation and its elimination (if not eradication) has progressively developed these last few years, especially after the acknowledgement in the Western world of the potential impact of disinformation campaigns on the electoral process and social stability of many a democracy. Empirical observations and analyses are part of the fight against disinformation as they allow for a better, mutualized understanding of issues and concepts related to disinformation.

## Treatment

Various actors operate withing the context of the fight against disinformation, each using its own tools and practices. One can however distinguish **three key-steps in the treatment process of information**: its **Detection**, its **Qualification** as disinformation or problematic information and lastly the **Reaction** to this kind of content.
Each actor determines the **threshold** after which information goes from the Detection phase to the Qualification phase.  **Criteria** used to Qualify a Detected information are defined independently by each actor. When the **sum of the probabilities that one or more of these criteria is filled goes above said threshold**, information is upgraded from Detection to Qualification. 

This threshold is delimited according to the **resources** an actor has and is willing to allocate towards the treatment of an information. The bigger the resources, the higher the **reactivity** of the actor to this information.  The threshold thus depends on the "importance" of the information as measured by the agent, _i.e._ **according to specific criteria**.

By "Qualification", one means the **analysis** of information according to such criteria, which permit its definition and **categorization**. 

These criteria ara **as various as the ones defining them**. For instance, a Foreign Affairs Ministry will not have the same criteria as an Interior Ministry, for whom the "foreign" dimension of an issue is of minor importance, if of any. The same goes for agents like NGOs, who tend to focus on an **angle** (and the specific criteria that go with it) of information depending on their range of action. Therefore, these criteria narrow the **scope of Reaction** of the agents who define them.

Here, we chose to limit ourselves to five main criteria, which are the **massiveness, the artificiality, the foreignness, the harmfulness and the verifiable falsehood or misleading nature** of information.
