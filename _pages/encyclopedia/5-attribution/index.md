# Attribution

The phase in which responsibility is assigned to some entity for an information manipulation campaign.

After some content has matched all [criteria](concepts/criteria) in the [Qualification](qualification) phase, investigation and forensics can be used to attribute responsibility.

Attribution is a difficult business, as false hints can be left to impersonate and mislead a public reaction to the wrong entity. It would be trivial, for example, to buy artificial followers to inflate some targetâ€™s audience without their assent or even knowledge, in order to get them accused of then artificially boosting their message.

Most of the practices in this phase relate to the fields of OSINT (Open-Source INTelligence) and forensics analysis.
