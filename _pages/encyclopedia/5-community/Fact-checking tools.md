## In the EU

1. [InVID](#1-invid)
2. [Truly Media](#2-truly-media)

### 1. [**InVID**](https://www.invid-project.eu/)

#### By whom ?

InVID is a project co-funded by the European Commission started in January 2016 and achieved in December 2018. 

#### What ? 

It focused on video verification of "eyewitness media", with the goal to develop an innovative verification platform "_to detect emerging stories and assess the reliability of newsworthy video files and content spread via social media_". Indeed, editing softwares and content management tools increasingly allow for the spread of fabricated, manipulated, deceiving videos. Content verification is costly and time-consuming for news outlets.

The InVID platform was built to help "_detect, authenticate and check the reliability and accuracy of newsworthy video files and video content spread via social media_".

It works through a verification application, a mobile application, a visual analytics dashboard as well as a verification plug-in (among others) which offer online services for video fragmentation, reverse image search and annotation, a logo detection tool, a context aggregation and analysis tool as well as a rights management service.

#### What for ? 

InVID allows its users to quickly verify video content and make sure that it is rights-cleared and readily available. It helps avoiding the spread (by mistake) of false information or fakes by media outlets. 

#### For whom ?  

Mainly, InVID is useful for "_broadcasters, news agencies, web pure-players, newspapers and publishers_" because it allows them "_to integrate social media content into their news output without struggling to know if they can trust the material or how they can reach the user to ask permission for re-use_".

#### Additional information

InVID is a follow-up project of RevealEU. WeVerify is a follow-up project of both InVID and RevealEU.


### 2. [**Truly Media**](http://www.truly.media/)

#### By whom ?

Truly Media was co-developed by the [innovation lab](http://ilab.atc.gr/) of the [Athens Technology Center](https://www.atc.gr/) (ATC) as well as [Deutsche Welle Innovation](http://blogs.dw.com/innovation/). With [TruthNest](https://github.com/Ndpnt/desinfo.quaidorsay.fr-wiki/wiki/Social-bots#2-truthnest), it is one of the two main tools of ATC's iLab in fighting disinformation. Truly Media can be considered as a follow-up project of several other research projects linked to the European Commission. It is funded by the Google Digital News Initiative.

#### What ? 

Truly Media is an online collaboration platform working on the verification of digital content on social networks. 
Users can monitor social networks, gather information from various sources, collaborate, use effective verification tools, extract and visualize information, etc. Information and content can be organized in collections and shared quickly among users.

#### What for ? 

Truly Media was created to help with the verification of _"digital (user-generated) content residing in social networks and elsewhere_". 

#### For whom ?  

The main targets of the project are journalists and human rights workers and investigators, _ie_ actors who helped in its design and development.

#### Additional information

On 8 April 2019, Truly Media officially announced its collaboration with the European Science Media Hub (ESMH).

1. [ClaimReview markup](#1---claimreview-markup)
2. [The Fact-Check Markup Tool (FCMT)](#2---the-fact-check-markup-tool)
3. [Fact-Check Explorer](#3---fact-check-explorer)

### 1 - ClaimReview markup

[ClaimReview](https://schema.org/ClaimReview) can be described as a specific type or format of **fact-checking review**. It focuses on **claims made or reported in creative work**. Among properties of a ClaimReview are the claim reviewed, its rating and its aspect (part of the claim to which the review is relevant), along with the review itself. It was developed by the collaborative entity [Schema.org](https://schema.org/docs/about.html), of whom companies such as **Google** and Microsoft are founders.

A ClaimReview markup is thus a sort of beacon, a tag, which recognizes the ClaimReview format. It indicates to machines what humans can see, which is whether an item is a fact-checking article or not- and therefore whether a claim has been verified.

Such reviews, _i.e._ ClaimReview structured data, can be **included in one's fact-checking web page** or site **independently**, or through Google's [**Fact Check Markup Tool**](https://toolbox.google.com/factcheck/markuptool).

### 2 - The [Fact-Check Markup Tool](https://toolbox.google.com/factcheck/markuptool)

#### Description

The [FCMT](https://toolbox.google.com/factcheck/about#fcmt) was specifically developed by Google. It allows fact-checkers, journalists and publishers to **easily add a ClaimReview markup to their fact-checking articles**. This is also possible without using the tool, however the structured review has to be embedded in the code of the article, which can be too technical a process for some actors.

With the FCMT, a summarized version of a fact-check can be displayed in Google Search  results along with the fact-checker's page. Indeed, search engines will be able to recognize said page as (hosting) a fact-checking article. In this summary are included the nature and author of the claim and a brief assessment of its truthfulness, among other data.

#### Use

Any fact-checker can add and edit ClaimReview markup to its articles, however one cannot review its own claim.
To create markup, one has to be registered with a Google account email address and use the [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about). The account must be listed as a restricted user or full user of the site it wishes to create markup for.

In order to use the FCMT, publishers have to indicate, on top of the ClaimReview itself, a link to their fact-checking article on their site or page, a summary of the assessed claim and their rating.

PolitiFact, Snopes, Le Monde, France Info, FactCheck.org, The Washington Post and AFP Factuel all use the FCMT. Therefore, their reviews are displayed on Google's FCE.

## 3 - [Fact-Check Explorer](https://toolbox.google.com/factcheck/explorer)

[Fact-Check Explorer](https://toolbox.google.com/factcheck/about#fce) is another Google fact-checking tool. Both the FCMT and FCE "_aim to facilitate the work of **fact checkers, journalists and researchers**_".

FCE is a **search engine** specifically designed to **browse and search for fact-checks**.  It allows users to search topics or statements by keywords and displays "_a list of matching claims and the corresponding fact checks_" sortable by languages.
It also offers an overview of recent fact-checks, accesible through a button on the main search page.
